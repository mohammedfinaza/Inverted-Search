# Inverted-Search
This project uses data structures to build an efficient system for indexing and retrieving content like words or numbers. It keeps track of how often each item appears in different files and where they are located. By combining hash tables and linked lists, it ensures fast and reliable performance, making it easier to handle and search through large amounts of data.
